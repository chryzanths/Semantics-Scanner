# Semantics Scanner

**The Semantic Analysis** - Semantic Analysis makes sure that declarations and statements of program are semantically correct.

Create a Semantic Analyzer program that will accept a single line assignment statement written in Java.

**Examples:**

1) int x = 1;

2) String str = “Hello World”;

3) double number;

#

**Your program should determine if the data type that is used to declare the variable is correctly matched to the value it is being assigned.**

 #

**Sample input/output 1:**

Enter Expression: int x = 1;

Semantically  Correct!

 #

**Sample input/output 2:**

Enter Expression: int x = 2.0;

Semantically  Incorrect!
